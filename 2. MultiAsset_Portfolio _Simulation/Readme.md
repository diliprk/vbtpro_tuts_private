## Project Goals

- Run the entire steps in `Double Bollinger Band` (2BB) strategy (in a very concise, manner) pertaining to 5 or more FX instruments.
- Set different weight allocations to the USDCAD and USDJPY, just to show the concept of manual weight allocations
- Plot portfolio allocations using `pf.plot_allocations().show()`
- Build `plot_strategy()` using `plotly-dash` and use `groupby` operations to see results for each instrument by selecting them using a drop-down list
